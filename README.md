## Motivation
The most important part of applying for a job and getting an interview is having a very formal and concise resume. 
The important part of building a resume are
* Proper Formatting
* Keep the content short and formal 

Now the problem of formatting is already been taken care of by using many customizable templates. The latter is very stressful and time consuming for students.
To say the capabilities of ChatGPT are good is an understatment. OpenAI has built this amazing tool which can make our tasks easier and faster with reliable accuracy. 

To solve this problem, I've built a resume builder which takes data needed for the resume and use GPT to make the the job description formal. The description input doesn't have to be formal.
